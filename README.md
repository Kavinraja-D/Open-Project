## Overview
The **Face Detection Project** is a Python-based application that uses machine learning techniques to detect faces in images. It utilizes OpenCV and other libraries to accurately identify and highlight facial features in real-time or from static images.

## Features
- **Real-time Face Detection**: Utilizes a webcam to detect faces in real-time.
- **Image Processing**: Detects faces in static images.
- **High Accuracy**: Uses pre-trained models for accurate detection.
- **Customizable**: Adjust detection parameters for different use cases.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to set up and use with clear instructions.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies and set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FaceDetection.git
    cd FaceDetection
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate` and 
    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Follow these instructions to use the Face Detection application:

### Running the Notebook
